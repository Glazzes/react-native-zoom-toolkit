## Motivation
Pinch to zoom is a must have feature for any application that displays images to the user, this one can be found in a wide variety of use cases:
- Zooming in media contained a chat message
- Detail screens
- Cropping an image or video
- Image galleries

The idea behind this library is to provide a set of components and utilities for the most common use cases of the "pinch to zoom" interaction.


## Features
- **Limitless**: Smoothly zoom in and out any component you want, you're not limited to images only.
- **Performance:** Smooth gesture interactions powered by Reanimated and Gesture Handler.
- **SnapBack Zoom:** Zoom in and snap back, this component automatically snaps back to its original position once the gesture ends, making it ideal for previews.
- **Resumable Zoom**: Pick up where you left last time! This component remembers your previous interactions with it, just the same way it works in your Android/IOS OS integrated gallery application, making it ideal for detail screens and gallery screens.
- **Crop Zoom:** An ideal, practical and unopinionated component for image and video cropping needs.
- **Expo Go Compatible**: This library has been written in typescript and supported modules by the expo go app.
