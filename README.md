> [!WARNING]
> This library is in active development in order to bring a bettter development experience to the React Native community.

**<p style="text-align: center;">Â¡Snap back or resume the choice is yours!</p>**

## Features
- **Limitless**: Smoothly zoom in and out any component you want, you're not limited to images only.
- **Performance:** This libray is written with `Reanimated v3 (v2 compatible)` and `Geture Handler v2`
- **Resetable Zoom:** Zoom in and snap back, this component automatically snap backs to its original position once the gesture ends, making it ideal for zoomable previews.
- **Resumable Zoom**: Pick up where you left last time! This component remembers your previous interactions with it, just the same way it works in your Android/IOS OS integrated gallery application, making it ideal for detail screens.
- **Customizable Settings:**  Customizable zoom and gesture configuration settings.
- **Expo Go Compatible**: This library has been written with typescript only and supported modules by the expo go app, don't worry about recompiling your app. 


## Getting Started
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library relies on both Reanimated and Gesture Handler being part of you project, if you do not have them installed already please refer to [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/) and [Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation) installation guides.

Install `@glazzes/react-native-zoomable` in your project

```sh
npm install @glazzes/react-native-zoomable
```

## Components: TODO

#### ResetableZoom
For the most basic of usages, import the `ResetableZoom` component from `react-native-zoomable` and wrap a component of your choice with it, for instance:

```jsx
import {ResetableZoom} from "@glazzes/react-native-zoomable"

{/* normal use case */}
<ResetableZoom>
  <Image source={{uri}} style={styles.image} resizeMethod={"scale"} />
</RestableZoom>

{/* dinamically resizes to  match with aspect ratio */}
<ResetableZoom resizeConfig={{
  size: {width: 200, 200},
  aspectRatio: 1.5,
  scale: 1.75
}}>
  <Image source={{uri}} style={{ flex: 1 }} resizeMethod={"scale"} />
</RestableZoom>
```

>[!NOTE]
>This component works by overlaying an animated view on top of your component, therefore it blocks any touch to your component, consider using `onTap` and `onDoubleTap` properties.
